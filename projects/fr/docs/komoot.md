# Komoot

This page is more dedicated to Komoot. Small German company that developed quite well. It is also much more community driven.

It is my goto platform when it goes to planning a tour or a track. We used Komoot during our [tour in Morocco](https://www.komoot.com/collection/2597355/-maroc-sud-5-jours-gravel): contrary to Strava, it has a multi-day feature which is handy to plan multi-day tours. I am not planning my tour though, my goal is to ride as quickly as possible with a 2-3 day outlook windows ahead.

But for smaller sections, Komoot remains helpful. And my Garmin data gets uploaded to my [Komoot profile](https://www.komoot.com/user/2060116877346?ref=imk-qr). You can follow-me there as well to see it.
