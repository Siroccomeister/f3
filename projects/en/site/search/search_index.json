This is especially true in \"frontier states\" like Alaska or Montana.</p> <p>This flexibility and diversity allow many Americans today to choose a place that suits their aspirations. As a result, they move a lot. The sparsely populated states make a lot of effort to be attractive because more population means more federal weight.

There\u2019s a place to work on the bike; I attempt to clean it using a \"sprinkler,\" which means a grass sprinkler that turns 360\u00b0. My bike looks great. I do, too, in the process.</p> <p>Kai found a set of paints on the trail a week ago and created a mural. A bit of the blue from my bike will remain for posterity. Life is simple.</p> <p>Clotaire is working on a film about his journey; I hope to share the link with you in a few days. He loves coffee and tattoos. He\u2019s excellent at flying drones (and at coffee-making).</p> <p>Everyone here has their own journey and follows their own path, and there is a lot of tolerance and mutual respect.

Very good and vegetarian for a change!</p> <p>On my way to Sparwood, my rear tire goes flat. It's tubeless, yet I can't find any holes or leaks. But as soon as I reinflate, it deflates again after a few kilometers. I\u2019m not too keen on getting out the artillery and putting in a tube. I'm aiming for Fernie as my destination (50 km) where there are three bike shops that can take a closer look. I keep inflating as I go - it's manageable.</p> <p>In Sparwood, I come across Titan. You\u2019ll see the details in the photo of its plaque, but it's the first time I\u2019ve walked under a truck. It must be in the Guinness World Records! It's true - the whole region here lives off coal mining. You see museums and monuments everywhere. And you mainly see Titan \u263a\ufe0f. At night, we hear endless coal trains. I checked, the longest ones have 150 cars and measure over 2.4 km. It's a different dimension here.</p> <p>Arriving in Fernie, I get the bike checked. They tell me everything is fine, they inflated it fully and added tubeless liquid. I also buy a small gas cartridge, useful for resealing, I think. It seems to be holding; I'll stay more vigilant.</p> <p>A local resident is proud to show me the famous Ghost Rider - when the sun shines on the mountain, you can see the shadow of a horse and rider emerging from the mountain. A local specialty, the name is used everywhere. I eat with John and John from New York, a father and son (62 and 28), who are following the Divide.

It's great.</p> <p>Last discussions with John &amp; John, I love how they talk about their country. Too bad we don't move at the same pace.

It's 33 degrees! I stop in the first town, Eureka, to eat. I've never seen so many churches with different names. Otherwise, very pretty. The meal is the same on both sides of the border: Burger (I'll tell you more about the food).</p> <p>Speaking of the border - I wondered why it was drawn so straight. Wikipedia teaches me that it's actually the 49th parallel that defines the border. So, I am exactly at the same latitude as Paris tonight. Funny.</p> <p>I arrive at my campsite: the bicycle station. A welcome reserved for cyclists. There's no one but everything is open. They have set up cabins to leave the bike and sleep next to it. There are showers, a garden, a bike repair workshop, a kitchen, fridge, and living room. And all of this is at your disposal. There are a few such places along the route that are extraordinary. I finally meet the owner Siri, who comes from Norway. Her husband Chris, a carpenter, built everything.
