# Helena and Park Lake

I hit the road again and quickly find my rhythm. The rest has done me good. I arrive in Helena, stop by the bike shop for a little maintenance, and then head out, arriving at a beautiful wild lake, just for me 🤩, at the end of the day. The weather is unpredictable. 100 km and 2,000 m of elevation gain.

# Goodbye Lama (Alpaca) Ranch

I try my first pancakes, and I’m honestly thrilled. Accompanied by freshly ground coffee from our barista Clotaire. What more could you ask for to start the day? Obviously, leaving before 10 AM isn’t possible... I give a big hug to each person, especially to our host, John Keller.

# The Journey

The first climb aims for Helena, 60 km away. Surprise! After 35 minutes, a sudden hailstorm. Then rain, and 15 minutes later, the sun? What’s going on?

The descent is a bit dangerous; there are very tricky dips to cross. I slip once. I have to slow down (I love descents). The last few kilometers are along the highway, but there’s enough room, and I’m making good progress. Upon arriving in Helena, I’m a bit disappointed. I stop by the bike shop, meet John for a Blackfoot beer (a local brew named after the nearby Indian reservation), and then head out again. I want to push on and reach Park Lake where I can camp. The lake is a gem. Of course, I go for a swim—there’s no one around!

# On the Bike Side

Cleaning the chain and adjusting the derailleur did wonders at the ranch yesterday. I’m feeling good today. I’m carrying less water, trying to resupply gradually. So, I’m lighter 😉. Things are moving along well. In Helena, I have the rear rim tape replaced. Yesterday, in the sun, the sealant was coming out through the spoke holes and along the rim 😆. Shocking. It was still holding, but I prefer not to take any risks. The bike shop is called The Garage. They took me right away—bike ready and cleaned in 45 minutes. Awesome. I also included a photo of what’s called “washboard.” It’s the bumpy track that makes the bike shake. It’s horrible on the descent; the whole bike shakes, and it’s hard to brake—there's no contact. Very, very unpleasant!

# Thoughts of the Day

I appreciate having been able to take some distance. A lot of things don’t miss me at all. The essentials remain. Family, kids, my faith, friends. I spend my time reflecting with a much less cluttered mind. It creates space, and a feeling of freedom grows each day. The landscapes help...

There’s also the athletic challenge. To be able to ride and cross the US in 30 days, I need to stay focused. Everyone I meet plans for double the time. Some good ideas aren’t useful enough... I’ll save them for later. There’s a kind of filter that sets in, which also allows me to remain calm.

See you tomorrow!
