# TF - Tempus Fugit

You become a dot watcher when you start looking at a dot moving on a map. For the Tour Divide, Trackleader is a nice solution. So I registered with the monicker [TF for Tempus Fugit](https://trackleaders.com/dividei.php?name=Tempus_Fugit). This allows a dedicated page which keeps track of history as well.

## Trackleader GDMBR map

GDMBR actually stands for Great Divide Mountain Bike Route. And when that route gets raced, it is called Tour Divide. There are few nuances between the two but they are largely same.

But I also like the general map with all riders. You can look me up with the other, by the way white stands for those travelling southwards and grey for those going north.
