This is how far I prepared for this adventure since November 2023 and as of July 22nd.

As you can see, I more or less started seriously biking in 2022 only but have made significant progress drive by my preparation. I basically tried to ride about 2 hours a day with one rest day and one longer ride on week-ends. To be honest, there have been numerous exceptions to this. Still I am in pretty strong shape!
