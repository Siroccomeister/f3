## Tour Divide 2025 vs my GDMBR 2024

In order to follow the Tour Divide 2025 riders (the [Trackleader dot watching](https://trackleaders.com/tourdivide25f.php) is great for this), I uploaded the [Tour Divide 2025](https://bikepacking.com/plog/2025-tour-divide-preview/) trace together with my own 2024 GDMBR track (albeit with reduced number of points), in order to help me reconcile their progress with the places I have been. Also interesting to see the alternates between GDMBR and TOUR DIVIDE. Great to have access to tools like the [gpx.studio toolbox](https://gpx.studio).
