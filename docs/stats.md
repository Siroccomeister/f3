# Driving by Numbers

This sections shows the daily details of my bike trip with all possible stats. You can also access the gpx files with elevation maps and so on.

The overall numbers :

Full riding days from BANFF to ANTELOPE WELLS were 35 days.
I also had 1 ZERO DAY (no ride at all) and a few REST DAYS (less than 3 hours riding). Which in total made up 39 DAYS. And 2 DAYS to get from CALGARY to BANFF. 

TOTAL KM from BANFF to ANTELOPE WELLS/Mexican Border : 4'411 km.
TOTAL KM from CALGARY to ANTELOPE WELLS/Mexican Border : 4'581 km.
On average I rode at 16.6 km/h with 8 hours/day.
