# Rig

This page will display all equipment related content and aims at explaining some of my (more or less difficult) choices.

My objective was to stay below 22Kg (bike and all gear, excluding myself and the water/food consumables). To give this some perspective my weight is 70Kg for 175cm and my bike frame supports a max of 120Kg. Now that makes a total of 92Kg. Adding water and consumables I will get close to 100kg.

Considering the rough terrain and the effort of biking keeping 20Kg of spare sounds like a good idea...

Some difficult questions and decisions made:
- I need to plan for heat/hot days as well as cold and potentially long/rainy days
- I need to be able to carry water : from 4L to 8L (in some areas)
- Do I need to have a gas cooker with me? Opinions vary but I decided to go for it.
- Dynamo? I decided not needed as I will not be racing nor will I bike during the night

I have been estimating my weight using the [Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/) website.
You can have a peak below, it is quite handy and detailed. Some tuning is still ongoing as I write.
