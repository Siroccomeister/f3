<figure markdown>
![My Proud OpenUP](day0/openup.jpg){ width="500px" }

<figcaption markdown>Part of my Tour Divide project</figcaption>

![Morocco Atlas](../../assets/images/0MarocSelfie.jpg){ width=“300” }
<figcaption markdown>Where decisions are getting matured</figcaption>

</figure>

Ces quelques lignes visent à tester un blog qui puisse m'accompagner dans mon

need also a workflow for pictures...
