# Welcome on my Great Divide 2025 project

This is my repository to log all my learnings, preparation and blogs in support of my endeavour : cross the USA by riding the [Great Divide Mountain Bike Route](https://bikepacking.com/routes/great-divide-mountain-bike-route-gdmbr/).

# The story that made it possible

It all started in 2023 when a German podcast showcased a book about the "Tour Divide". I had bought myself a gravel 6 month before and thought to myself : I'd love to undertake such an adventure (bucket list type of venture). In fact, if nothing prevents it, I would actually do it.

And one year later, many things happened and made it actually possible. Including taking a sabbatical, leaving a long time employer and preparing for a new professional/career step.

# Why this blog

Originally I did not mean to maintain a blog. But many asked how to follow me. And yet I wanted also to capture my daily moments, consolidate my experiences, elaborate on inspirations. Finally I also wanted to give back and inspire others so I decided to create this dedicated website. And as a promoter of open source, running it on GitHub was a nicer option than resolving to user made-for platforms (Wordpress, PolarStep), as good as they may be. This flexibility also allows me to design it in a way as I can use it myself ðŸ˜‰.
