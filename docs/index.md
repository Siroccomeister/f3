This is my repository to log all my learnings, preparation and blogs in support of my endeavour : cross the USA by riding the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route.

# The story that made it possible

The spirit and background. It all started a year ago when a German podcast showcased a book about the "Tour Divide".

# How to link to this blog

Social cards are enabled and can easily be forwarded on social media platforms. Although I am not a huge fan of those, so many friends and relatives asked me for it that I decided to do it.

Open Source, inspiring and re-usable for others on their own shape and form.
