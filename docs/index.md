# Welcome on my Great Divide 2024 project

This is my repository to log all my learnings, preparation and blogs in support of my endeavour : cross the USA by riding the [Great Divide Mountain Bike Route](https://bikepacking.com/routes/great-divide-mountain-bike-route-gdmbr/).

# The story that made it possible

It all started in 2023 when a German [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCLnrkmezkJR3Myov4To9yl1Wb4_OSTyb) showcased a book about [the "Great Divide"](https://www.amazon.de/Great-Divide-Gravelbike-durch-Mountains/dp/3846409693#immersive-view_1721994856052). I had bought myself a gravel 6 month before and thought to myself : I'd love to undertake such an adventure (bucket list type of idea). In fact, I starting planning ahead that if nothing would prevent it, I would actually do it. And here I am now!

One year later, many things happened and made it actually possible. Including taking a sabbatical, leaving a long time employer and preparing for a new professional/career step, family and supportive friends, physical preparation... long list. But encouraging list.

# Why this blog

Originally I did not mean to maintain a blog. But many asked how to follow me. And I also wanted to capture my daily moments, consolidate my experiences, elaborate on inspirations. I also wanted to give back and inspire others.

So I decided to create this dedicated website. And as a promoter of open source, running it on GitHub was a nicer option than resolving to user made-for platforms (Wordpress, PolarStep), as good as they may be. This flexibility also allows me to design it in a way as I can use it myself ðŸ˜‰.
